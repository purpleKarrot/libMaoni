blah blah..

[section Git]
[@http://git-scm.com/ Git] is a free & open source, distributed version control
system  designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
speed and efficiency.

Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full
revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central
server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.

[section CMake]
[@http://www.cmake.org/ CMake] is a family of tools designed to build, test and
package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process
using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake
generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler
environment of your choice.

[section Doxygen]
[@http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ Doxygen] is a documentation system for
C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL (Corba and Microsoft flavors), Fortran,
VHDL, PHP, C#, and to some extent D.

[section BoostBook]
The [@http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boostbook.html BoostBook] documentation
format is an extension of [@http://www.docbook.org/ DocBook], an SGML- or
XML-based format for describing documentation. BoostBook augments DocBook with
semantic markup that aids in the documentation of C++ libraries, specifically
the [@http://www.boost.org/ Boost C++ libraries], by providing the ability to
express and refer to C++ constructs such as namespaces, classes, overloaded
functions, templates, and specializations.

[section QuickBook]
[@http://www.boost.org/doc/html/quickbook.html QuickBook] is a WikiWiki style
documentation tool geared towards C++ documentation using simple rules and
markup for simple formatting tasks. QuickBook extends the WikiWiki concept. Like
the WikiWiki, QuickBook documents are simple text files. A single QuickBook
document can generate a fully linked set of nice HTML and PostScript/PDF
documents complete with images and syntax- colorized source code.

[section Qt]
[@http://qt.nokia.com/ Qt] is a cross-platform application and UI framework.
Using Qt, you can write web-enabled applications once and deploy them across
desktop, mobile and embedded operating systems without rewriting the source
code.
[endsect]

[section Qt Property Browser]
The [@http://qt.nokia.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/Widgets/qtpropertybrowser
Qt Property Browser Framework] provides a browser widget that displays the given
properties with labels and corresponding editing widgets.

[@http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq18-propertybrowser.html] shows how to use file
properties.

[section Boost LA]
[@http://www.revergestudios.com/boost-la/ Boost LA] provides a set of generic
linear algebra algorithms, primarily for working with vectors and matrices of
static size. The library also defines vector and matrix data types, however it
allows users to introduce their own types by specializing the
[@http://www.revergestudios.com/boost-la/vector_traits.html vector_traits] and
[@http://www.revergestudios.com/boost-la/matrix_traits.html matrix_traits]
templates.

Note that Boost LA is not part of Boost.

[section Equalizer]
[@http://www.equalizergraphics.com/ Equalizer] is the standard middleware to
create and deploy parallel OpenGL-based applications. It enables applications to
benefit from multiple graphics cards, processors and computers to scale the
rendering performance, visual quality and display size. An Equalizer application
runs unmodified on any visualization system, from a simple workstation to large
scale graphics clusters, multi-GPU workstations and Virtual Reality
installations.

[section IceT]
The [@http://www.cs.unm.edu/~kmorel/IceT/ Image Composition Engine for Tiles] is
a high-performance sort-last parallel rendering library. In addition to
providing accelerated rendering for a standard display, IceT provides the unique
ability to generate images for tiled displays. The overall resolution of the
display may be several times larger than any viewport that may be rendered by a
single machine.

IceT is currently available for use in large scale, high performance
visualization and graphics applications. It is used in multiple production
products like [@http://www.paraview.org/ ParaView] and
[@http://www.llnl.gov/visit VisIt]. The IceT library is quite stable now.
Although development has slowed, you can track it with the
[@https://www.ohloh.net/p/IceT Ohloh] project.

[section Open MPI]
The [@http://www.open-mpi.org/ Open MPI] Project is an open source
[@http://www.mpi-forum.org/ MPI-2] implementation that is developed and
maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open
MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from
all across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best
MPI library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software
vendors, application developers and computer science researchers.
